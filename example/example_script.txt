First Bubble.
â€”

Second Bubble. This one is not supposed to be on the same panel as the previous bubble.
-

[nib] Not that it really matters : it's just to show that some special characters can be ignored. In this case, a long dash was on the previous line to signify a change of panel.

[sfx] Another bubble, this one is a double-bubble. First part is sfx styled.
// Second part, will be a sfx too, because no style has been defined on this line.

Another double-bubble. First part is yelling style. [yell]
// The second part, on the other hand, will be handwritten. [handwritten]


002# [italic] [all the bubbles on this page will be written in italic, unless the style is overriden on a line]
[nib] A text not in bubble.

A big bubble...
// All the part of this multi-bubble will be written in italic
// Because no override style has been defined, and the page style is "italic"

Giga pudding! [yelling] [this bubble will be written in yelling style, even if the page was set to "italic"]


003#
[blank] [this page has no text, it won't be typesetted]


004# [not a style, just a note]
[sfx] Some sfx

[newspaper] Tonight at eleven.

[sfxib] Sfx in balloon.
